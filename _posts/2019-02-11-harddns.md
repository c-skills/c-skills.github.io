title: harddns DoH trickery
---

I polished my experimental *DoH* implementation [repo](https://github.com/stealth/harddns)
to include support for the most common public *DoH* servers as well as speeding
things up. I started this project more than 2y ago and it was the first
usable *DoH* Linux integration at the time being, when only `8.8.8.8` was available
and *DoH* was not an [IETF RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8484/).

Yet, I was not really reading the RFC and still have my problems with *DoH*
from privacy perspective (centralization of DNS lookups), even if it adds
encryption.

Most *DoH* vendors still want you to install some weired proxy or tunneling
software or rely on browsers supporting it natively. However, you can
also just use this small footprint NSS module.

Since starting of the project quite some time has passed and we also have *TCP Fast
Open* and *TLS 1.3* available today, which has been integrated into *harddns* too.

So I again went ahead, comparing the three major public *DoH* services:

 * [Quad9](https://www.quad9.net/doh-quad9-dns-servers)
 * [Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/dns-over-https)
 * [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https)

Lets start with *Quad9*. I like it because it has the best redundancy
and seems the only of the three that actually offers that service on
IPv6 too. Unfortunally, its neither supporting *TCP Fast Open* nor *TLS 1.3*
and therefor has the worst latency:

As can be seen theres a normal TCP 3whs (you have to capture the 2nd TCP connection of corse)
and *TLS 1.2*. The *wireshark* dumps show a `ping kernel.org` from 0 to the first *ICMP Echo*
thats leaving the NIC. Thats exactly the *DNS lookup penalty*. In this case its **0.16s**.

*Google* is better with **0.11s** latency of *DoH* turnarounds. You can see that the
*TLS Client Hello* is within the first TCP packet, also carrying the **TH_SYN**:

The best of three is *Cloudflare* with only **0.07s** latency.

Additional to the Fast Opening, you also see *TLS 1.3* which has a shorter
handshake sequence.

This comparison explains why I re-ordered the nameserver list in `harddns.conf`
to have `1.1.1.1` at first.

I hope that *Quad9* will soon add *TCP Fast Open* and *TLS 1.3*, as this is just
a minor config thing (depending on the web server used). At the end, if you
want to compete with the others, latency of DoH is key. Even if you have better
redundancy. If the browsing session feels non-interactive, nobody will stick
with it at the end.

Of corse, the efficiency of the server software itself also adds to the latency,
but thats also a solvable problem, in particular if you have lot of nodes that you
can actually distribute the requests to; and I also assume that all candidates
use some form of caching their DNS lookups so that they do not have noticable latency in
their backends.
