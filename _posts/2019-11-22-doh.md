title: D'oH! no-IPv6-workaround trickery
---

I added a workaround to my [harddns](https://github.com/stealth/harddns)
DoH project. Some browsers accept AAAA records and prefer them
over A records, even when there is no IPv6 connectivity. Inside
the NSS module, it is hard to distinguish these cases and its certainly
not our task to check for IPv6 connectivity during DNS resolves.
Therefore, I added a `nss_aaaa` config flag, which needs to be enabled
if you want the NSS module to lookup AAAA records for certain
`gethostbyname()` calls. *Certain* - because within various incarnations
like `gethostbyname2()`, `getaddrinfo()` etc., some of these functions
lead to NSS 'backend'-functions which can make the case by checking
an address-family parameter. Some functions can't and will use the
`nss_aaaa` helper flag from the *harddns* config. It is disabled by
default, so if you use *harddns* via the NSS config, you need to enable it, if you
have IPv6 connectivity and want to profit from it.
The DoH proxy server works as before, since its just translating between
DNS and DoH back and forth.
