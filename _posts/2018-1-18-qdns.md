title: QDNS rebinding
---

Inspired by [tavisos Transmission RCE](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/951526615145566208),
courtesy of a DNS rebinding vulnerability, I added a load-balancing capability
to [qdns](https://github.com/stealth/qdns). Depending on the view,
you may either say you are load-balancing via DNS RR RR scheduling :) or driving
a DNS rebinding attack. Theres a sample on how to do it in the `test.zone` file:
