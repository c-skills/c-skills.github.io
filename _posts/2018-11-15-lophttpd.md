Made some updates to the [lophttpd git repo](https://github.com/stealth/lophttpd):

* Building for *Android* with NDK r17b; the previous NDK version was a bit
  outdated
* Made some fixes to properly compile on *NetBSD* (missing `sendfile()`; why?)
  and *FreeBSD*
* Cleaning up the build process
* Made some changes so that the project also nicely builds with `clang` by just
  changing `CXX` inside the Makefiles.

Hah! If I just managed to create a bootable *OpenBSD* image from their 80's
style boot setup, I could have told you that it also runs on *OpenBSD*.
It most likely will, but I need more time setting up such environment!
