title: OpenSSL BIO trickery
---

I just updated the [psc git repo](https://github.com/stealth/psc)
to fix some crypto stupidities I made a decade ago; also throwing away
RC4 algo and substituting it by proper AES stream cipher mode and proper
IV-handshaking. Stream cipher is needed to get rid of fixed block size requirement
which does not apply well to a shell session.
Yet, it still requires hardcoded keys on both ends of the session.

So, I renewed an older project to do full blown TLS handshakes over a pty session!
Not the TCP thats beyond your portshell, but the PTY session thats on top of it.

Initially, it failed back then, because *OpenSSL* has a buggy BIO implementation
for their Base64 filter BIOs. BIOs allow to stack arbitrary filter layers
together to be used as transport for *OpenSSL*. So you are not bound
to plain TCP sockets, but may also use FIFOs or whatever - if you just supply
the right BIO. In my case, I wanted to use PTYs as transport, which requires the
data to be properly Base64 en/decoded on the fly. Since the integrated
Base64 filter BIO has issues with its newline signalling (despite of which NL
ctrl options I set), I was forced to create my own.

Little surprise, *OpenSSL* hides the API from the developer, so you eventually have
to copy and cast the internal struct. It looks like this:


```cpp
#ifndef psc_bio_h
#define psc_bio_h

extern "C" {
#include <openssl/bio.h>
}

namespace ns_psc {

typedef void (*bio_info_cb)(BIO *b, int oper, const char *ptr, int arg1, long arg2, long arg3);

struct bio_method_st {
	int type;
	const char *name;
#if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x10101000L
	int (*bwrite) (BIO *, const char *, size_t, size_t *);
#endif
	int (*bwrite_old) (BIO *, const char *, int);
#if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x10101000L
	int (*bread) (BIO *, char *, size_t, size_t *);
#endif
	int (*bread_old) (BIO *, char *, int);
	int (*bputs) (BIO *, const char *);
	int (*bgets) (BIO *, char *, int);
	long (*ctrl) (BIO *, int, long, void *);
	int (*create) (BIO *);
	int (*destroy) (BIO *);
	long (*callback_ctrl) (BIO *, int, bio_info_cb);
};

const BIO_METHOD *BIO_f_b64();

}

#endif
```

In my eyes, it makes little sense to hide/abstract away this API from developers. There rather
should be a plugin-mechanism so one can easily add arbitrary filters.


The `struct` is pretty clear. One provides the hooks for reading and writing as well
as some control functions. One then implements it as follows:


```cpp
[...]


struct b64_ctx {
	string input{""};
};


int b64_write(BIO *b, const char *buf, int blen)
{
	string b64 = "";

	BIO *next = BIO_next(b);
	int n = blen > 1024 ? 1024 : blen, r = 0;
	string s = string(buf, n);
	b64_encode(s, b64);
	b64 += "\n";

	do {
		if ((r = BIO_write(next, b64.c_str(), b64.size())) <= 0)
			return r;
		b64.erase(0, r);
	} while (!b64.empty());

	return n;
}

[...]

int b64_write_new(BIO *b, const char *data, size_t datal, size_t *written)
{
	int ret;

	if (datal > INT_MAX)
		datal = INT_MAX;

	ret = b64_write(b, data, (int)datal);

	if (ret <= 0) {
		*written = 0;
		return ret;
	}

	*written = (size_t)ret;
	return 1;
}


[...]

long b64_ctrl(BIO *b, int cmd, long num, void *ptr)
{
	BIO *next = BIO_next(b);
	b64_ctx *ctx = reinterpret_cast<b64_ctx *>(BIO_get_data(b));

	switch (cmd) {
	case BIO_CTRL_RESET:
	case BIO_CTRL_FLUSH:
		ctx->input.clear();
		break;
	case BIO_CTRL_PENDING:
		if (!ctx->input.empty())
			return 1;
	default:
		break;
	}

	return BIO_ctrl(next, cmd, num, ptr);
}


int b64_create(BIO *b)
{
	b64_ctx *ctx = new (nothrow) b64_ctx;
	if (!ctx)
		return 0;
	BIO_set_data(b, ctx);
	BIO_set_init(b, 1);
	return 1;
}


int b64_destroy(BIO *b)
{
	delete reinterpret_cast<b64_ctx *>(BIO_get_data(b));
	BIO_set_data(b, nullptr);
	BIO_set_init(b, 0);
	return 1;
}


long b64_callback_ctrl(BIO *b, int cmd, bio_info_cb cb)
{
	BIO *next = BIO_next(b);
	return BIO_callback_ctrl(next, cmd, cb);
}


static bio_method_st biom_b64 = {
	0x743c7350,
	"psc BIO b64",
#if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x10101000L
	b64_write_new,
#endif
	b64_write,
#if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x10101000L
	b64_read_new,
#endif
	b64_read,
	nullptr,
	nullptr,
	b64_ctrl,
	b64_create,
	b64_destroy,
	b64_callback_ctrl
};


const BIO_METHOD *BIO_f_b64()
{
	return reinterpret_cast<const BIO_METHOD *>(&biom_b64);
}

```

The full code may be found in the git repo. Easy, eh? Once the working Base64 filter
is in place, you can go ahead and use your `SSL_connect()` as normal. The TLS handshake
will then be done on top of the PTY, which is a pretty cool thing to do. Since you may
then use all the pinned-certificate checking on top of otherwise plaintext
port shells and run a TLS session on a formerly plaintext shell.

I think it may help other developers who struggle with *OpenSSL* BIOs and want
to write their own.
