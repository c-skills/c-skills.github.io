While everybody is freaking out about social networks selling and leaking
your data (told you so) the same way they freaked out about XKS (why
would the gov want to read your email or have incentives to lie to you??),
I uploaded a neat tool called `number`. Its similar to `file` for files
and may be found [here](https://github.com/stealth/number).

Sure, you can do everything at the Python console, but at some (EC-)point,
it starts to get ugly.

If you are sick of writing REST APIs to collect data about people and are good in crypto & reversing,
feel free to reach out to the c-skills team.
