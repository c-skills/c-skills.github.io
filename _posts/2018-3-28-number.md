While everybody is freaking out about social networks selling and leaking
your data (told you so) the same way they freaked out about XKS (why
would the gov want to read your email or have incentives to lie to you??),
I uploaded a neat tool called `number`. Its similar to `file` for files
and may be found [here](https://github.com/stealth/number).

Sure, you can do everything at the Python console, but at some (EC-)point,
it starts to get ugly. It goes like this:

```
$ ./number -x FFFFFFFF00000001000000000000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
hash: SHA256
ec: prime256v1 prime,
prime: Yes
match: No
bytes: 32
bits: 256
$ ./number -m AAAAIFrGNdiqOpPns+u9VXaYhrxlHQawzFOw9jvOPD4n0mBL -X
bits: 255
hex: 5AC635D8AA3A93E7B3EBBD55769886BC651D06B0CC53B0F63BCE3C3E27D2604B
bytes: 32
match: No
prime: No
ec: prime256v1 b,
hash: No
$
```
